**Note for using P5.js framework**
I already set up the p5.js framework on my local machine so all you guys have to do is pull it. (Git pull)
Basically, just make sure your index.html and sketch.js is in a folder with all the js files and addons and modules folder. You can use any text editor such as Sublime or Brackets or the editor of your choice. 

**We need a local server to do our dev work**
I am not going to go through setting up Apache on all 3 of your machines, so we're going to use PHP's built in web server function.
The command is:

```php
cd CS4436
php -S localhost:8000
```
